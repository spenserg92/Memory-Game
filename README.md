# Memory-Game

This memory game was inspired by the mini memory games in some of the classic mario games. I loved playing those growing up. While this is a simple version it brings me back to the many hours I spent playing those games.

# User Stories

As a user, I want the ability to...
  - click to start the game
  - keep track of wins/losses
  - be informed of number of guesses
  - start a new game with a regenerated board
  - be informed when I win or lose
